We continued out discussion onto the next step of the simulation â€“ road and
connected tiles (or so to be called "areas").

We are now able to create road tiles and only allowed to construct the RCI zones
adjacent to any road tiles. This forms an _area_ visually that we can use to
simulate smaller scale of city. In example, an area might contain its own
residential, industrial and commercial areas that the villagers may live and
find their jobs in this area.

In specific, we want to start by this ratio of **2 residents to 1 industrial worker
and 1 commercial worker**. The idea is that residents, once start living, needs
to find a job to produce _goods_ in industrial areas. Each good produced in the
industrial area needs to be sold in commercial; thus creating another job
opportunity in commercial area.

The focus this week will be mainly on defining the connected tiles and employment
in the connected tiles (area).

Following step becomes obvious to **taxes** and **land values/happiness**.

## Meeting notes

Ratio:

```
Residential 2
Industrial 1
Commercial 1
```

Residential -> finds a job in Industrial -> opens up another job in commercial

After able to define employment flow,
taxes and land values come next.

Taxes: 9%
Land Value / Happiness
